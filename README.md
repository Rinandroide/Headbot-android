<br>
# Step 1
Clone this repository on your machine and open one of the receiver patch examples to play with Max, PureData or Processing.
<br>
# Step 2
*** the app is temporarily unavailable *** 
On your Android device - Go to Google Play Store and download the <i>Headbot</i> app. <br>
<br>
# Step 3
Open the app and grant camera permission. You must give access to camera because it is needed by face detector.
<br>
# Step 4
On the app go to settings and insert the ip address of the machine you want to control. Then tap on CONNECT to enstablish an OSC connection through port 3000. <br>
N.B. The receiver patch must be opened before enstablish connection. Ensure that android device and host machine are on the same network.
